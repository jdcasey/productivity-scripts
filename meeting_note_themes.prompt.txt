First, read about_me.md to understand my profile and role in the company, and undestand the scope of my work.

Then, review the Gemini meeting notes downloaded from my recent Google calendar, which have been condensed into a notes.txt file by repomix.
The note files in the repomix output were organized primarily between meetings I accepted, rejected, or didn't acknowledge; and organized secondarily in chronological order.

Given this information, provide the following:


    Summary of discussion themes, ordered by intensity and durability of the discussion over time. Add significant weight to things that happened in meetings that I DIDN'T accept.

    List of deadlines and confidence rating of their reliability, based on how commonly they were discussed.

    An assessment discussion tones, and a list of technical projects we might consider in order to address pervasive themes that have a negative tone.

    Tell me which discussions I completely missed or that had significant discussion I missed.
